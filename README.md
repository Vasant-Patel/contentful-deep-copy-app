# `Contentful Deep Copy Content App`

App for deep copying contentful entries


## How to use

Install it and run:

To test, you can create an app definition in your Contentful organization settings pointing to `http://localhost:1234` and registering the `app-config` location:

> Keep in mind that when you serve an app locally over `http`, you will get a warning about insecure content. You can ignore this during development.
